Description: AVR development board IDE and built-in libraries
 Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
 flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists,
 designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive
 objects or environments.
 .
 This package will install the integrated development environment that
 allows for program writing, code verfication, compiling, and uploading
 to the Arduino development board. Libraries and example code will also
 be installed.

Description: Code, examples, and libraries for the Arduino platform
 Arduino is an open hardware microcontroller platform.  This package contains
 the minimal set of tools to allow one to program an Arduino.  It also contains
 examples and libraries. For a CLI, see the 'arduino-mk' package.
 .
 This package does not include the Java based Integrated Development
 Environment, which can be found in the 'arduino' package.
